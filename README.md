# Coursera Portfolio

This was the capstone project for my react advanced course on coursera, organised by the meta staff.

## How to Run

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/theAbdikhaliq/portfolio-coursera

Copy

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd portfolio-coursera

3. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

npm install

4. Once the installation is complete, start the development server:

npm start

This command will start the application and automatically open it in your default browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. You should now see the React Mouse Position Tracker app running in your browser. The mouse position will be tracked and displayed in both the panel and as a point.

- react
- formik
- yup
- react-dom
- react-scripts
